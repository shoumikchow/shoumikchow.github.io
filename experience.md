### Work

My journey started right after high school, when I returned to my alma mater—[Mastermind School](https://www.mastermindschool.org/)—to teach English to sixth graders. Yes, I went from student to teacher in the same hallways!

In early 2016, I joined [G&R](https://www.green-red.com/) as an intern on the Android development team. It was a short gig (January to April), but a solid introduction to working with real-world code.

Then came [Panacea Live](https://www.panacea.live/) in April 2016, where I helped build tech to fight counterfeit products.

From February 2016 to January 2019, I worked at KolpoKoushol—first part-time, then full-time—doing a bunch of cool things that you can read more about on the [Research](../research) page.

In February 2019, I joined [Gaze](https://gaze.ai), the first computer vision company in Bangladesh, for a short (but sweet!) 6-month stint, tackling tough problems with some of the brightest minds in Bangladesh.

During my Master’s, I worked at the [Quantitative Imaging Lab](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~shah/) at the University of Houston, diving deep into graph structures and video analysis. 

Now, I’m at [Andium](https://andium.com), where I work with ML platform and computer vision to build some pretty cool stuff!
