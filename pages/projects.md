## Projects

* [bbox-visualizer](https://github.com/shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer) is a library that can be used to draw bounding boxes around objects as well as label them. This tries to solve the pain points of positioning the label according to the bounding boxes. You have to do some clumsy math to make it look good. 

  This library helps make that very easy. You just use the bounding box locations and their corresponding labels and the library takes care of everything. Additionally, there are some other cool visualizations that you can use other than the standard label on top of the boxes.
