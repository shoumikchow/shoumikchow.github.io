## Research

My undergraduate thesis, led by [Dr. Tarem Ahmed](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/faculties/41), turned into a conference paper that was published at Tencon, a premier international technical conference of IEEE Region 10, in 2018. We made an inexpensive robot to map interiors using sonar-based SLAM.

I worked at [KolpoKoushol](https://www.facebook.com/KKoushol/), a knowledge initiative led by [Dr. Nazmus Saquib](nsaquib.com), where we published a paper at NeurIPS. Our paper showed that according to three major English newspapers of Bangladesh, there is a clique that exists &mdash or seems to exist according to newspaper coverage &mdash between the top politicians of Bangladesh who only talk about themselves and amongst themselves while ignoring more pertinent issues that exist in the country.
