## About me

I am originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

When I am not working, I like travelling, hiking and reading long-reads.

I enjoy listening to podcasts and music and can never make up my mind which one to listen to so I switch back and forth frequently. I like taking photos. You can find a heavily-curated gallery on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shoumikchow/).

I like board games and playing chess ([send me a challenge!](https://chess.com/play/shoumikcfc)).

I am a massive supporter of Chelsea Football Club. Come on Chelsea!
