## About

I am originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

When I am not working, I like travelling, hiking, reading [books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/shoumikchow) and watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/shoumikchow/)

I enjoy listening to podcasts and music ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/shoumikchow)) and can never make up my mind which one to listen to so I switch back and forth frequently. I like taking photos. You can find a carefully curated gallery on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shoumikchow/).

I like board games and playing chess ([send me a challenge!](https://chess.com/play/shoumikcfc)).

I am a massive supporter of Chelsea Football Club. Come on Chelsea!
