### Education
* University of Houston (Houston, Texas, USA)  
MS in Computer Science, 2021

* BRAC University (Dhaka, Bangladesh)  
BS in Computer Science, 2016


### Work

I first started working straight out of high school as an English Language teacher at [Mastermind School](https://www.mastermindschool.org/), the same high school I graduated from. I taught English to sixth grade students.

I was an intern at [G&R](https://www.green-red.com/) from January 2016 to April 2016 where I was in the Android development team.

In April 2016, I got a job at [Panacea Live](https://www.panacea.live/) where I worked on technology to protect consumers from counterfeit products.

From February 2016 to January 2019 at KolpoKoushol (initially part-time and then full-time), detailed in the [Research](../pages/research) page.

In February 2019, I started working at [Gaze](https://gaze.ai) where I had a short but very sweet 6 month stint working with the smartest people in Bangladesh to solve difficult computer vision problems.

Currently, I work at the [Quantitative Imaging Lab](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~shah/) at the University of Houston where I work with graph structures and vidoes.
