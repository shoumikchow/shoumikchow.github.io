### Work

I first started working straight out of high school as an English Language  teacher at [Mastermind](https://www.mastermindschool.org/), the same high school I graduated from. I taught English to sixth grade students.

After graduating from BRAC University, I started working at KolpoKoushol, detailed in the [Research](../pages/research) page.

While at KolpoKoushol, I got a job at [Panacea Live](https://www.panacea.live/) for 1.5 years as a backend developer where I worked on technology to protect consumers from counterfeit products in the market.

I quit Panacea Live to concentrate on research work with KolpoKoushol.

After KolpoKoushol, I started working at [Gaze](https://gaze.ai) where I had a short but very sweet 6 month stint, working with the smartest people in the country to solve difficult computer vision problems.
