Super happy to say that my first paper was accepted in the conference proceedings of [Tencon](http://tencon2018.org/), a flagship conference of IEEE in the Asia-Pacific region. You can find the accepted paper [here](../files/tencon2018.pdf) and the BibTeX [here](../files/tencon2018.bib).

My research area of interest has changed vastly since, but working on this paper taught me how to conduct research which was a valuable experience.

There's some exciting news that I can't want to share, but that'll have to wait just a bit!
