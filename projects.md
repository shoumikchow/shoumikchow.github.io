### Featured Project

#### 📦 [bbox-visualizer](https://github.com/shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer)
A Python library that simplifies the visualization of bounding boxes and object detection results in computer vision applications.

**What it solves:** Traditional bounding box visualization requires complex mathematical calculations for proper label positioning. This library eliminates that pain point by handling all the positioning logic automatically.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Easy to use** - Just provide bounding box coordinates and labels
- ⚡ **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with minimal setup
- 📊 **Production ready** - Robust and well-tested for real-world use

**Recognition:**
- 🏆 Featured on the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24608662)
- 🎙️ Highlighted on the [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/202/jupyter-is-back-in-black) podcast
