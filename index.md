# Hi!

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Andium](https://andium.com) working on all stages of the machine learning pipeline. I am interested in computer vision and MLOps. I am also interested in data for good, and am constantly working towards marrying my two interests.

I like dabbling in different fields to gain knowledge from a diverse range of domains to go beyond traditional ways for solving problems.

I love meeting new people, collaborating and having interesting conversations! You can email me at: **hello [at] shoumikchow [dot] com**
