# Hi!

I am a CS Masters student and Research Assistant at the Quantitative Imaging Lab at the University of Houston. I am broadly interested in computer vision. I am also interested in data for good, and am constantly working towards marrying my two interests.

I like dabbling in different fields to gain knowledge from a diverse range of domains to go beyond traditional ways for solving problems.

My current research focuses on understanding how graph structures change over time in videos.

I love meeting new people, collaborating and having interesting conversations! You can email me at: **hello [at] shoumikchow [dot] com**

**_I am in the job market for a deep learning/computer vision position that starts in the summer of 2021_**
