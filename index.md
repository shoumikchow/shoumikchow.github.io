# Hi!

I am a CS Masters student and Research Assistant at the Quantitative Imaging Lab at the University of Houston. I am broadly interested in computer vision. I am also interested in data for good, and am constantly working towards marrying my two interests.

I like dabbling in different fields to gain knowledge from a diverse range of domains to go beyond traditional ways for solving problems.

My current research focuses on understanding how graph structures change over time in videos.

I love meeting new people, collaborating and having interesting conversations! You can email me at: **hello [at] shoumikchow [dot] com**

* **[March 1 2021]** I was recently interviewed about my experience in computer vision, how I got into the field and my expectations of the future. Read it on the [2D3D.ai blog](https://2d3d.ai/index.php/2021/02/28/meet-the-community-member-shoumik-sharar-chowdhury/).
* **[July 19 2021]** I joined [Andium](https://andium.com) today where I will be working with ML Ops and computer vision. I'll be WHF from Houston for now but who knows what the future holds :wink: Very excited for this new adventure!
