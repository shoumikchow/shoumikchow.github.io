## About

Hi! I'm from Dhaka, Bangladesh. 🇧🇩

When I’m not working, you’ll probably find me daydreaming about my next trip, lost in a [book](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/shoumikchow), or deep into a [movie](https://letterboxd.com/shoumikchow/) rabbit hole.

I can never decide between podcasts or music—so I just keep switching back and forth. (Decisions are hard.) You can peek into my current audio chaos on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/shoumikchow).

I love taking photos too. My [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shoumikchow/) is where I stash the ones that made the cut.

Big fan of board games, and I’ll never say no to a good chess match—[challenge me](https://chess.com/play/shoumikcfc) if you’re feeling brave. ♟️

Oh, and I’m a *very* loyal Chelsea FC fan. Come on you Blues! 💙
