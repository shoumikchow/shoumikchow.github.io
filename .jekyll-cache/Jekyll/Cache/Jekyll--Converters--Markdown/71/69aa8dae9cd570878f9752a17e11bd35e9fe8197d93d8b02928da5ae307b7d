<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<p>I first started working straight out of high school as an English teacher at <a href="https://www.mastermindschool.org/">Mastermind</a>, the same high school I graduated from. I taught English to sixth grade students.</p>

<p>After graduating from BRAC University, I started working at KolpoKoushol, detailed in the <a href="../pages/research">Research</a> page.</p>

<p>While at KolpoKoushol, I got a job at <a href="https://www.panacea.live/">Panacea Live</a> for 1.5 years as a backend developer where I worked on technology to protect consumers from counterfeit products in the market.</p>

<p>I quit Panacea Live to concentrate on research work with KolpoKoushol.</p>

<p>After KolpoKoushol, I started working at <a href="https://gaze.ai">Gaze</a> where I had a short but very sweet 6 month stint, working with the smartest people in the country to solve difficult computer vision problems.</p>
