I"¹<h1 id="hi">Hi!</h1>

<p>I am a CS Masters student and Research Assistant at the Quantitative Imaging Lab at the University of Houston. I am broadly interested in computer vision. I am also interested in data for good, and am constantly working towards marrying my two interests.</p>

<p>I like dabbling in different fields to gain knowledge from a diverse range of domains to find non-traditional ways for solving problems.</p>

<p>My current research focuses on understanding how graph structures change over time in videos.</p>

<p>I love meeting new people, collaborating and having interesting conversations! You can email me at: <strong>hello [at] shoumikchow [dot] com</strong></p>
