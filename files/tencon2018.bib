ABSTRACT="This paper presents a solution for Simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) with an autonomous differential drive robot in an indoor
environment. We extract data from sonars and analyze it to construct a map
of the explored area using occupancy grid mapping. In addition, relative
positioning approaches provide location using an inertial measurement unit
(IMU) and wheel encoders. Localization and mapping are essential tasks for
an autonomous robot's navigation or exploration without a prior map and the
system is based on discrete step-wise or event modeling which guides its
navigation. The system's result is compared for accuracy against an actual
map. The results show that the approach is largely accurate although the
resolution of the map produced could be improved."
